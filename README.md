# Product API
A containerized REST API written in Python to manage products and inventories. The goal of this project is to create a 
REST API that will allow for the management of inventories of products. A `product` will have a `sale_price`, 
`purchase_price`,`supplier`, `product_name` and `product_id`. An `inventory` will have an `inventory_id`, 
`inventory_location`. Many products will then be assigned to an inventory with their quantity stored.
